# Segment

### Description
Segments (dendrite) are where the synapses connects. There are two types of dendrite segments, proximal and
distal.
- A *proximal segment* segment forms synapses with feed-forward inputs. The active synapses on this
type of segment are linearly summed to determine the feed- forward activation of a column.
- A *distal segment* segment forms synapses with cells within the layer. Every cell has many distal
dendrite segments. If the sum of the active synapses on a distal segment exceeds a threshold, then the
associated cell enters the predicted state. Since there are multiple distal dendrite segments per cell, a
cellâ€™s predictive state is the logical OR operation of several constituent threshold detectors.
