# Hierarchical Temporal Memory
### Overview
This repository is an attempt to re-implement [Numenta](https://numenta.com/)'s [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core), with references and adoptations of the [HTM-Community](https://numenta.org/)'s [fork](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core).

### Goals
* To have a simple architectural design for easy understanding, integration and portability.
* To serve as a personal way of learning the details of the [HTM Framework](https://numenta.com/blog/2019/01/16/the-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence/) concepts.

### Features
* Added visualization :wink:
