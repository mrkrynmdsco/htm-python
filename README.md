# Hierarchical Temporal Memory in Python
## Overview
This repository is an attempt to re-implement [Numenta](https://numenta.com/)'s [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core), with reference and adaptation of the [HTM-Community](https://numenta.org/)'s [fork](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core).

## Purpose
* To have a new and simple architectural design of the library for easy understanding, integration and portability.
* To serve as a learning reference on the details of the [HTM Framework](https://numenta.com/blog/2019/01/16/the-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence/) concepts and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (if needed).
